# Parrrley, Your Friendly Pirate Translation App
> Ever heard of national Talk Like a Pirate Day? That's every day with Parrrley!

## When? Why?
Parrrley was created in about 24 hours between Friday, July 17th and Saturday, July 20th. A team of four--Tanner, John, Zane, and Zach--entered MLH's HackItShipIt Hackathon with the goal of creating a React app and having fun while doing it. With a nautically themed hackathon, it was easy enough to come up with an idea.

## How?

We created a single-page React app that takes plain English input and translates it into pirate-speak. Using a healthy amount of RegEx, we match the user's input to our pirate dictionary. If there's a match, the word is translated!

You'll also find some Parrrley-o-meters which measure the piratey-ness of your text. Ideally, those go up as the text is translated.

One of the hardest parts of this project was creating a RegEx to match the bases of words so that we could correctly change them in consideration of tense, pluralization, and possessiveness. English is crazy! We tried to incorporate Speech Recognition as well, but that ended up taking too much time for the final demo.

In the future, we'd love to include a larger dictionary of pirate terminology as well as the Speech Recognition mentioned earlier. Batten the hatches and set the sails! We're off to another adventure.
